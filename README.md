I used Kaggle to create a multiple regression model using sample housing price data.

# Multiple Linear Regressions of Housing Data to Predict Price

-In this project I will be using multiple linear regressions to predict housing price data.

# STEPS

-Load and clean the data

-Perform exploratory data analysis on the data to identify the most useful data points

-Fit a multiple linear regression model

-Evaluate and refine the model and adjust to improve R^2 and RMSE values

-Create visualizations of the results

# Results
The final test statistics were an R-squared value of .792 and Root Mean Squared Error of 39979.43. These means the model explains 79.2% of the variability of the data and predicts housing prices on average within $39,979.43.

An R-squared value of .792 is considered moderately strong. Future improvments can be made by adding more relevant predictors, increasing sample sizes by incorporating more data sets, selecting predictor variables with more variance, and reassessing predictor variables with high multicollinearity.
